ALGORITHM VISUALIZER
by TAIKI KAWANO AND BOYD PELLEY (for sleep sort algorithm)
October 30th, 2023 - November 5th, 2023

ABOUT:
created to highlight the efficiency of various algorithms and their
Capabilities with various input sizes.

WHAT IT DOES:
It shows a bar graph that shows a visually appealing animation of each sort that the
algorithm does and plays a post-animation after each one. Each algorithm will display
the runtime, big O notation, my personnel rank on it, and the number of items in the list.
There are seven different algorithms to choose from, each with the option to do an instant sort. Which removes
the delay of the animations of the algorithms and uses their raw sorting abilities.

TYPE OF PROJECT:
