ALGORITHM VISUALIZER
by TAIKI KAWANO
October 30th, 2023 - November 5th, 2023

ABOUT:
created to highlight the efficiency of various algorithms and their
Capabilities with various input sizes.

WHAT IT DOES:
Shows a bar graph that shows a visually appealing animation of each sort that the
algorithm does and plays a post-animation after each one. For each algorithm it will display
the runtime, big O notation, my personnel rank on it, and the number of items that were in the list.
There are seven different algorithms to choose from each with its option to do an instant sort. Which removes
the delay of the animations of the algorithms and uses their raw sorting abilities.
